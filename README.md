![Code Coverage](./badges/coverage.svg)

A GitHub Action that automatically syncs Dependabot security alerts to Jira
issues with **configurable due dates based on severity levels**.

üè¢ **Enterprise-ready** with GitHub App authentication for enhanced security and
scalability.

## ‚ú® Features

- üîê **Enterprise-Ready Authentication**: GitHub App authentication
  (recommended) with fine-grained permissions and auto-rotating tokens
- üõ°Ô∏è **Automatic Security Alert Sync**: Fetches Dependabot alerts and creates
  corresponding Jira issues
- ‚è∞ **Severity-Based Due Dates**: Configure different due dates for critical,
  high, medium, and low severity alerts (calculated from alert creation date)
- üîÑ **Smart Updates**: Updates existing Jira issues when alerts change or are
  dismissed
- üéØ **Auto-Close Resolved Issues**: Automatically closes Jira issues when
  Dependabot alerts are fixed or dismissed in GitHub
- üß™ **Dry Run Mode**: Test the action without making actual changes
- üéØ **Flexible Filtering**: Filter by severity threshold and dismissed status
- üìù **Rich Issue Details**: Includes vulnerability details, CVSS scores, CVE
  IDs, and GitHub links
- üîß **Highly Configurable**: Customize Jira project, issue types, priorities,
  labels, and assignments
- üß™ **Comprehensive Testing**: 80%+ code coverage with extensive unit tests

## üîß Setup Requirements

### 1. Jira API Token

1. Go to
   [Atlassian Account Settings](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens)
2. Click "Create API token"
3. Add the token as `JIRA_API_TOKEN` in your repository secrets

NOTE: The `jira-username` must match the owner of the API token

### 2. GitHub Authentication

**Choose ONE of the following authentication methods:**

#### Option A: GitHub App (‚≠ê Recommended) üè¢

1. **Create GitHub App:**
   - Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Developer settings** ‚Üí **GitHub Apps** ‚Üí **New
     GitHub App**
   - Configure permissions:
     - ‚úÖ Security events: Read
     - ‚úÖ Contents: Read
     - ‚úÖ Metadata: Read
   - Disable webhooks (not needed)

2. **Install on repositories:**
   - Go to app settings ‚Üí **Install App**
   - Select repositories

3. **Add secrets:**
   - `DEPENDABOT_APP_ID`: Your app ID
   - `DEPENDABOT_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`: Your app's private key (download .pem file
     content)
   - `DEPENDABOT_APP_INSTALLATION_ID`: Installation ID from the URL

**GitHub App advantages:**

- ‚úÖ Fine-grained permissions
- ‚úÖ Organization-owned (not user-tied)
- ‚úÖ Auto-rotating tokens
- ‚úÖ Better for enterprise security

#### Option B: Personal Access Token (Alternative) üîë

1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Developer settings** ‚Üí **Personal access tokens** ‚Üí
   **Tokens (classic)**
2. Click **"Generate new token"**
3. Select scopes:
   - ‚úÖ `security_events` (read security events)
   - ‚úÖ `repo` (access repositories)
4. Add token as `DEPENDABOT_PAT` in repository secrets

**Note:** The default `GITHUB_TOKEN` has limited access to Dependabot alerts.
You must use either a GitHub App or PAT for this action to work properly.

### 3. Jira Permissions

Ensure your Jira user has permissions to:

- Create issues in the target project
- Search issues in the project
- Add comments to issues

## üìù Example Jira Issue

The action creates comprehensive Jira issues with all relevant security
information:

```
Summary: Dependabot Alert #42: Critical vulnerability in lodash

Description:
*Dependabot Security Alert #42*

*Package:* lodash
*Ecosystem:* npm
*Severity:* CRITICAL
*Vulnerable Version Range:* < 4.17.12
*First Patched Version:* 4.17.12

*Description:*
Versions of lodash before 4.17.12 are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution.
The function defaultsDeep could be tricked into adding or modifying
properties of Object.prototype using a constructor payload.

*CVSS Score:* 9.8
*CVE ID:* CVE-2019-10744
*GHSA ID:* GHSA-jf85-cpcp-j695

*GitHub Alert URL:* https://github.com/company/repo/security/dependabot/42

---
_This issue was automatically created by the Dependabot Jira Sync action._

Due Date: 2024-01-16 (Critical severity = 1 day from alert creation)
Labels: dependabot, security
Priority: High
```

## üîç Dry Run Mode

Test the action without making changes:

```yaml
- name: Test Dependabot Sync
  uses: yourusername/dependabot-jira-sync-action@v1
  with:
    jira-url: 'https://company.atlassian.net'
    jira-username: 'test@company.com'
    jira-api-token: ${{ secrets.JIRA_API_TOKEN }}
    jira-project-key: 'TEST'
    dry-run: 'true' # üß™ No actual changes will be made
```

## üéØ Auto-Close Functionality

The action can automatically close Jira issues when the corresponding Dependabot
alerts are resolved in GitHub. This ensures your Jira board stays clean and
up-to-date.

### How It Works

1. **After processing new alerts**, the action searches for existing open Jira
   issues labeled with "dependabot"
2. **Extracts alert IDs** from issue titles (e.g., "Dependabot Alert #42") or
   descriptions
3. **Checks GitHub** to verify the current status of each alert
4. **Automatically closes** Jira issues where alerts are:
   - ‚úÖ **Fixed** (patched by a dependency update)
   - ‚úÖ **Dismissed** (manually dismissed in GitHub)
   - ‚úÖ **Not Found** (alert was deleted)

### Configuration

```yaml
auto-close-resolved: 'true'
close-transition: 'Done' # Your Jira workflow transition
close-comment: 'Alert was automatically resolved in GitHub'
```

### Example Log Output

```
üîÑ Checking for resolved alerts to auto-close...
üîç Found 3 open Dependabot issues in Jira
‚úÖ Alert #42 is fixed - closing issue SEC-123
‚ÑπÔ∏è  Alert #43 is still open - keeping issue SEC-124 open
‚ùå Alert #44 not found - closing issue SEC-125
üìä Auto-closed 2 resolved issues
```

## üìä Monitoring & Observability

The action provides detailed logging:

```
‚úÖ Starting Dependabot Jira Sync...
üìç Repository: company/awesome-app
üîç Fetching Dependabot alerts for company/awesome-app
üìã Found 5 total alerts
üéØ 3 alerts match severity threshold: medium
üîÑ Processing alert #42: Critical vulnerability in lodash
‚úÖ Created Jira issue TEST-123 for alert #42
üîÑ Processing alert #43: High severity issue in axios
‚ÑπÔ∏è  Found existing issue: TEST-100
‚úÖ Updated Jira issue: TEST-100

üîÑ Checking for resolved alerts to auto-close...
üîç Found 2 open Dependabot issues
‚úÖ Alert #39 is fixed - closing issue TEST-95
‚ÑπÔ∏è  Alert #40 is still open - keeping issue TEST-98 open

üìä Summary:
- Alerts processed: 3
- Issues created: 1
- Issues updated: 1
- Issues closed: 1
‚úÖ Dependabot Jira Sync completed successfully
```
